# **telnets**

User interface to the TELNETS protocol. TELNETS is the secure version of the TELNET protocol.

TELNETS is the TELNET protocol over a secure TLS (or SSL) connection.


## Usage
```
telnets host [port]
```


## TELNETS vs SSH

Note that TELNETS and SSH are not the same thing.

SSH is considered a secure alternative to the (un-secure) TELNET protocol.
(And note that is "TELNET" without an "S" at the end.)

TELNETS (with an "S" at the end) is the secure version of (un-secure) the TELNET protocol.


## What does the "S" at the end mean?

The "S" at the end of "TELNETS" standards for "secure".
Just like the "S" at the end of "HTTPS".
